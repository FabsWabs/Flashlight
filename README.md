## Basics
You find yourself in a dark room, only having a small flashlight as a light source. Using the arrow keys, you have to try to find the goal. This way you encounter various objects, with some of them you can interact, with some of them you can't.

Also, a level editor is included, with which you can build and save your own levels.
